Add solidus_zip_zones to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_zip_zones'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_zip_zones:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell

Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
